When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
quick change from another computer, adding notes on the go directly to the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
mostly people will work from the same machine and only make changes on other machines on some rare occasions,
so in most cases the git is only used to back up and not as often to update

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clones are copies of repos, forks are basically cloned repos from other people to my own accound and/or local machine, branches are different parts in a repository with their own commits, 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
newest version of the files to work with, extra backup,

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
via a cloud service to share with other developers and a text files for changes and reviews, it would be harder to manage and some developers might miss some changes and
the files would definitely be harder to review

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
to update features or fix bugs in another branch, the master would still be unaffected and the new feature can be developed in parallel
