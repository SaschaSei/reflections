When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
quick change from another computer, adding notes on the go directly to the repository

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
mostly people will work from the same machine and only make changes on other machines on some rare occasions,
so in most cases the git is only used to back up and not as often to update

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
clones are copies of repos, forks are basically cloned repos from other people to my own accound and/or local machine, branches are different parts in a repository with their own commits,
